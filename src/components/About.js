              ‚ú®Since childhood, the area of creation and innovation has fascinated me. A little craft jugaads that lead my interest to the field of engineering, after observig the world that seems to be working on conditions and loops, made me develop interest in the field of programming.

              üåºYou may find me reading book or crocheting or scribbling my thoughts in my leisure. Best thing about me is that I like to observe and have different perspective for things. A little con about me is that I am bit of a procrastinator until determination hits me and a little underconfident.  
            </p>

              ü§ùI am looking forward to connect with you and create something amazing.
